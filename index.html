            Hi, my name is <b>GaoyuanHao</b>. I'm currently studying
            <b>Software Engineering</b> at the University of Melbourne. I love
            computer technology, and creating a software system from scratch and
            automating some of the boring and dull things that people would
            otherwise have to do is very interesting to me. At the same time I
            am very interested in <b>XR, AR </b> technology. I can't get enough
            of seamlessly integrating information technology into the real world
            and manipulating these virtual creations with the most natural
            operating logic. It's like magic coming to life. In regular software
            development,
            <b>my career goal is to become a full-stack software engineer.</b>
            Proficient in a variety of software development skills, covering
            front-end to back-end, programming to project management and more.
            If you'd like to learn more about my skills in software development,
            the <b>Hire me page</b> has a comprehensive overview!<br />
            <br />

            I like to fantasise. I fear the passage of time because I have no
            control over them and it will never go back. That's the reason why I
            love photography, because it allows me to record every second of my
            life and to save them for the future. I can remember what i done,
            what i was thinking, what i was feeling at that time. To me, that is
            another realise of time travel.
            <a class="image main">
              <sub
                >A shot I took on the Gold Coast in 2023, I really like the
                stars.</sub
              >
              <img src="images/photos/meGalaxy.jpg" alt=""
            /></a>
            I really like looking at stars, It is the most intuitive way for us,
            with our meagre powers, to peer into this vast universe that is
            literally almost infinite in size. Whenever I look at them, I can't
            help but wonder if the significance of my tiny existence might be
            relevant to it.
            <a class="image main">
              <sub>My shot of the galaxy.</sub>

            /></a>
            The question is often asked, what is your goal in life? For me,
            maybe the goal is to know the meaning or purpose of the universe or
            something like that. It may sound very unrealistic, and may even be
            an insoluble problem in itself, but it's always a good idea to work
            towards it. In the short term, how about trying to land on the moon?
          </p>

          <p>
            In the meantime I have a few other hobbies, I love to play guitar
            and painting.I've been learning to draw since I was a kid, as I've
            always loved Japanese anime. You can visit my
            <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/users/50988413">Pixiv</a> account to
            access my work. Most of my drawings are about those animated
            characters that I love, and it's just a great feeling to have your
            favourite character perform on a stage that you've created. At the
            beginning of 2023, after trying to draw with Ai, I decided to
            combine my own previously learnt drawing knowledge and my own skills
            as a programmer to create new works, instead of spending too much
            time practicing drawing on my own. The results were quite awesome.
